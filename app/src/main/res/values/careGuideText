    <h2>
        What is Carpal Tunnel?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Injury to the median nerve.</li>
        <li>

            The median nerve travels down the arm and enters a tight space near the wrist called the carpal tunnel.</li>
        <li>
            If the space becomes congested (swelling, bony changes, repetitive movements) it can cause pinching or compression on the median nerve, causing symptoms.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>How to prevent Carpal Tunnel?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Try to keep wrist in neutral position during activities</li>
        <li>
            Avoid sustained pinch or gripping</li>
        <li>
            Avoid repetitive overuse of the wrist during activities</li>
        <li>
            Avoid positioning wrist in bent or flexed posture when sleeping</li>
        <li>
            Have an ergonomic workstation </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>
        What is pregnancy induced CTS?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Usually occurs in 3rd trimester</li>
        <li>
            Pressure or swelling in the carpal tunnel puts pressure on the median nerve, causing symptoms</li>
        <li>
            Symptoms normally resolve postpartum</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>
        Symptoms of CT</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index, and middle fingers</li>	<li>

        Loss of dexterity </li>
        <li>
            Symptoms worse at night</li>
        <li>
            Symptoms worsened by repetitive forceful hand motion </li>
        <li>
            Improvement of symptoms after shaking or straightening the affected hand</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Conservative Management for CTS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Orthotics (custom or over the counter splint) to decrease CT pressure by positioning wrist in neutral</li>
        <li>
            Orthotics most effective if used within the first 3 months of symptom onset</li>
        <li>
            Orthotic should be worn at night and during the day if necessary </li>
    </ul>
